# Assessing-World-Happiness-Index-with-Pyspark
PySpark Exploration of World Happiness Data (Master's Project)

**Summary:** This Master's project explored trends in the World Happiness Index from 2015 to 2019.  Leveraging data obtained from Kaggle, I utilized Apache Spark (PySpark) for initial data exploration and analysis.  The project aimed to put my foundational PySpark skills to use and explore the data using SQL queries.  While not focused on business analysis, the project provided valuable experience in applying these data manipulation and analysis techniques to uncover statistical trends within the World Happiness Index data.

**Project Flow:**

**Data Acquisition and Exploration:**
  World Happiness Index data for 2015-2019 was obtained from Kaggle.
  Apache Spark (PySpark) was used to perform basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.

**Data Analysis with PySpark and SQL:**

  **This project aimed to:**

    Leverage my initial PySpark skills for data manipulation and exploration.
    Apply my understanding of SQL to query and analyze the data.

  **The primary focus was on:**
    Identifying statistical trends within the World Happiness Index data.
    Answering questions about the data using PySpark and SQL.
